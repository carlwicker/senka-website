          I was diagnosed with Bipolar Type 1 in 2001, following two psychotic
          episodes in India. Twelve years later, I experienced two more breaks,
          all of which resulted in admissions to various psychiatric wards under
          the Mental Health Act 1982, Section Two.

          In many cultures, psychosis is viewed not as a mental illness but as a
          Spiritual Emergency. My own experiences reflected this perspective. I
          felt as though a veil was being lifted to reveal a deeper reality,
          allowing me to see, hear, and experience life in a more profound and
          enlightened way. While this was at times awe-inspiring, it was also
          accompanied by fear and uncertainty.

          I've encountered a number of “Dark Nights of the Soul,” some of which
          felt like an ego death, and others like a re-enactment of past trauma.
          During the night that I have represented in this piece, I was
          convinced that my daughter had been killed, that my legs had been
          broken, and that I was blinded by fear. Through years of reflection, I
          now view these episodes as both a rapid spiritual journey and a mental
          health condition in need of treatment. I believe a more comprehensive
          understanding is needed—one that bridges both the spiritual and mental
          health aspects, which is currently lacking.
