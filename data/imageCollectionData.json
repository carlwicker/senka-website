      "All my life, I was told I was careless, lazy, distracted—a dreamer, a loner. Misaligned. Out of focus. Never quite “normal.”",
      "In the early 90s I launched a promising design career, working with the Royal Mail and David Hockney. But the same old judgments followed, and so did the setbacks.",
      "Everyday tasks—brushing my teeth, making tea, doing the dishes—felt impossible to sustain. Building simple habits seemed out of reach.",
      "In 2017, I was diagnosed with combined ADHD and ADD. That moment re-framed everything.",
      "This work reflects that shift—how understanding can transform struggle into insight, and chaos into creativity."

      "In many cultures, psychosis is viewed not as a mental illness but as a Spiritual Emergency. My own experiences reflected this perspective. I felt as though a veil was being lifted to reveal a deeper reality, allowing me to see, hear, and experience life in a more profound and enlightened way. While this was at times awe-inspiring, it was also accompanied by fear and uncertainty.",
      "I've encountered a number of “Dark Nights of the Soul,” some of which felt like an ego death, and others like a re-enactment of past trauma. During the night that I have represented in this piece, I was convinced that my daughter had been killed, that my legs had been broken, and that I was blinded by fear. Through years of reflection, I now view these episodes as both a rapid spiritual journey and a mental health condition in need of treatment. I believe a more comprehensive understanding is needed—one that bridges both the spiritual and mental health aspects, which is currently lacking."

      "Life gave me a good battering, and until 2017, I kept getting up and pushing forward. I rebelled against abuse, neglect, mental illness—my own and others’—grief, and the weight of single parenting.",
      "They called me the “smiler.” I hid behind it, worked hard, loved deeply, and explored the world with wide eyes and open hands.",
      "Then I hit a wall. A virus knocked me down for six months. I couldn’t get out of bed. Fatigue isn’t tiredness—it’s a collapse. Like batteries that never fully recharge, no matter how much you will them to.",
      "In this work, I’ve dropped the smile. This is what lives underneath, on repeat, 24 Hours a day, every day, year after year."
